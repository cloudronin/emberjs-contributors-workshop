## Pre-Work for EmberConf Contributor's Workshop

Hi! Thanks for participating in the EmberConf Contributor’s Workshop! 

We only have 3 hours for the event, so help make the most of your time, there are some things you need to do ahead of time. Most attendees should budget at least 2 hours for this and try to do it at least 5-10 days before the event. The facilitators will be best able to help walk you through any issues you encounter if they aren’t last-minute requests. Send any questions or requests for help to @locks and @jenweber on the [Ember.js Community Slack](https://ember-community-slackin.herokuapp.com/)

- Install the latest [stable ember-cli](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli/releases) `npm uninstall -g ember-cli &&
npm install -g ember-cli`
- Fork, clone, npm install, and test run projects you are interested in. This is essential to do ahead of time. While we hope and pray for the quality internetz, most wifi can’t handle 50 devs cloning and npm installing all at the same time.
- Browse open issues to form some goals for yourself. See list of repositories and some helpful links below. You can work on anything during the workshop. The list just contains suggestions. Look for
issues like "help wanted" or "good first issue" to guide your search.
- Have node, git, and npm installed, and have a GitHub account connected in git. If you need help with these steps, contact the facilitators.
- If you want to work on the https://emberjs.com [website](https://github.com/emberjs/website) or [The Guides](https://github.com/emberjs/guides), budget some extra time to install Docker or Ruby.
- If you are not familiar with Open Source workflows (forking, cloning, opening PRs), try it out in [this practice repository](https://github.com/jenweber/our-open-source-contributions), while following [this article of step-by-step instructions](https://medium.com/@jenweber/your-first-open-source-contribution-a-step-by-step-technical-guide-d3aca55cc5a6).

## Core libraries to browse for issues

## Help Wanted and Good First Contribution Issues
We’ve asked the maintainers of many ember projects to use the “good first issue” label to show which issues they’d like help on during the workshop. Again, you are welcome to choose any issue/project, but if you need ideas, click here to browse all of them! You might also want to search for “help wanted” issues.

If you want to choose one ahead of the workshop, you can add a comment that says you’d like to work on it.
